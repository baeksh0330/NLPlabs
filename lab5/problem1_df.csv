ROE는 5.1%로 하락하고, ROA도 0.32%로 낮아질 듯. 따라서 올해 자사주 매입 실시는 어려울 것으로 예상되며, 큰폭의 감익에도 불구하고 DPS를 전년수준인 550원으로 유지하고 배당성향을 30%로 맞추는 선에서 주주환원이 마무리될 전망",43.0,7.0,44.0,140.0,23.0,6.0,15.0,19.0,5.0,18.0,20.0,18.0,11.0,2.0,13.0,5.0,5.0,18.0,26.0,24.0,13.0,1.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,11.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,43.0,7.0,44.0,140.0,23.0,6.0,15.0,19.0,5.0,18.0,20.0,18.0,11.0,2.0,13.0,5.0,5.0,18.0,26.0,24.0,13.0,1.0,16.0,1.0,3.0,11.0,7.0,7.0,0.0,4.0,15.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,DGB금융지주,8130,8180
171,한국항공우주,24.07.30,2Q24 Re : 유의미한 Surprise,"한국항공우주의 2Q24 실적은 매출 8,918억원(YoY +21.6%, QoQ +20.5%), 영업이익 743억원(YoY +785.7%, QoQ +54.7%)으로 컨센서스(매출 8,683억원, 영업이익 523억원) 상회했다. 외형 성장보다는 수익성 개선에 주목한다. GPM(14.9%)은 YoY +7.0%p, QoQ +1.7%p 개선됐고, OPM(8.3%)은 YoY +7.1%p, QoQ +1.8%p 개선됐다. 기지 재건 프로젝트, 적자 사업 수주 등 과거 충당금 규모가 컸던 점 감안할 때 수익성 개선은 예정된 결과로 치부할 수도 있겠으나, 해당 기저 효과를 감안하더라도 GPM 14.9%는 만족할 만한 마진 수준이다. 국내 사업 비중이 절반이 넘는 현 시점에서 수출 사업의 GPM이 20% 전후의 수익성 기록했을 것으로 추정한다. 즉, 유의미한 Surprise다. 부문별로 보면, 1) 국내사업(매출 비중 55.9%)은 매출 4,982억원(YoY +2.4%, QoQ +13.6%)으로 성장세 지속됐다. KF-21, 상륙공격헬기를 비롯한 다수의 체계 개발 프로젝트와 TA-50, KUH 4차 양산 등이 매출로 인식됐다. 다만 KF-21 체계 개발이 거의 마무리되어가는점, KUH 마지막 납품 과정에서 매출 증가 폭은 전사 대비 소폭 하회했다. 2) 완제기 수출(매출 비중 16.9%)은 매출 1,506억원(YoY +182.0%, QoQ +66.2%)으로 큰 폭 증가했다. FA-50 PL이 꾸준하게 매출 반영됨과 동시에 말레이시아向 FA-50이 2Q24부터 진행률 인식으로 회계 기준 변경되며 매출 반영됐고, 이라크 CLS 및 기지 재건 프로젝트도 매출 반영 지속됐다. 3) 기체부품(매출 비중 25.9%) 매출은 2,309억원(YoY +22.4%, QoQ +12.6%)을 기록했다. Boeing의 업황 부진에도 불구하고 Airbus 및 Embraer 등에 대한 공급 꾸준히 지속되며 매출 증가세 이어졌다. 특히, 규모의 경제 효과와 고환율 영향 더해지며 기체부품 부문의 수익성 양호했을 것으로 추정한다.",30.0,17.0,12.0,46.0,10.0,12.0,23.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30.0,17.0,12.0,46.0,10.0,12.0,23.0,10.0,4.0,11.0,7.0,5.0,7.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,9.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,0.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,한국항공우주,55700,65400

EV 배수지표 하나만으로 기업의 가치를 측정하는 데에는 한계가 있으나, 직전 투자 밸류 이상으로 IPO 혹은 매각이 이루어져야 하는 만큼 단기간에 IPO 또는 매각 가능성은 높지 않은 것으로 판단한다. 카카오 자회사 중 SOTP 밸류에이션에서 가장 큰 비중을 차지하는 회사는 카카오엔터테인먼트이며, 그 다음이 픽코마와 모빌리티 순이다. 언론에 따르면, 카카오는 카카오엔터테인먼트, 모빌리티를 전략 자산이 아닌 매각 자산으로 분류하고 있다. 고로, 해당 지분의 매각 가능성을 검토해볼 필요가 있다고 판단한다. 또한, 네이버웹툰이 상장함에 따라 엔터테인먼트와 픽코마의 적정 가치에 대한 고민을 해 볼 시점이기도 하다. 매각 가치인 EV를 기준으로 피어 그룹과의 가치를 비교하고, 가장 최근 투자 유치 밸류를 기준으로 기업가치를 산정하는 것이 합리적인지 재검토하고 밸류에이션에서 할인율을 조정했다. 웹툰엔터테인먼트는 상장 초기 변동성이 큰 구간이지만, 3~4조 원 내외의 시가총액을 기록하고 있다. 7/26 시가총액을 기준으로 계산한 EV는 3.5조 원이며, 24F EV/SALES는 2배, EV/EBITDA는 60배로 글로벌 피어 대비 높은 편이지만, IPO 관련 일회성 비용이 사라지는 25년에는 EV/EBITDA 배수가 18배로 급감한다. 픽코마와 카카오엔터테인먼트의 EV는 대규모 투자를 유치한 밸류에 순현금을 제외해서 계산했다. 픽코마는 23년 말 기준 6,000억 원 규모의 순현금을 보유했다. 24년 매출 7,200억 원, OPM 15%, 감가상각비 200억원으로 가정했고, 25년도 전년 대비 매출 성장률은 20%에 OPM은 동일한 수준으로 가정했다. 엔터테인먼트는 PIF, GIC의 투자 유치 후인 11.3조 원을 기준으로 계산했으며, 24년 예상 매출액은 2조 원, OPM 5%, 감가상각비 500억원으로 가정했다. 25년도에는 매출이 2.5조 원까지 성장하고, OPM 7% 확대된다고 다소 공격적으로 가정했다. 두 기업의 24년도 기준 EV/SALES와 EV/EBITDA 배수는 각각 11배/64배, 6배/75배로 피어그룹 평균을 큰 폭으로 상회한다. 모빌리티 EV 규모는 21년도 4,000억 원 규모의 투자 유치 시 신주 발행가액을 기준으로 계산한 시가총액인 4.1조 원을 기준으로 계산했다. 24년도 매출액은 6,000억원, OPM 10%, 감가상각비 300억 원으로 가정했으며, 25년도에는 20%의 매출액 성장과 동일한 OPM 유지로 가정했다. 24년 기준 EV/SALES와 EV/EBITDA 배수는 각각 6배, 42배로 역시나 평균을 상회한다.",24.0,14.0,55.0,78.0,10.0,9.0,12.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,12.0,10.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,13.0,11.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,14.0,55.0,78.0,10.0,9.0,12.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,12.0,10.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,13.0,11.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,카카오,39400,35100

DRAM과 NAND 모두 업계 평균 및 동종업체대비 누적 가격 상승폭이 컸던 만큼 기저가 높았던 점이 주요인으로 분석된다. SK하이닉스의 DRAM 가격은 23년 2분기에 상승 전환한 이후 24년 1분기까지 57% 상승해 삼성전자 44% 및 Micron 12%보다 상승폭이 크다. NAND 역시 가격 하락이 멈춘 23년 3분기부터 24년 1분기까지 85% 상승해 삼성전자 41%, Micron 56%을 상회한다. HBM과 eSSD 매출 비중이 경쟁업체들보다 높아 믹스 개선이 선행되었기 때문이다. NAND 출하의 감소는 eSSD 외에는 수요가 강하지 않은 상황에서 수익성 중심으로 출하 정책을 펼친 결과로 해석된다. 재고평가 환입 규모는 하나증권의 추정치 5천억원을 하회하는 3천억원만 반영되었다.",15.0,9.0,19.0,36.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,9.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.0,9.0,19.0,36.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,0.0,9.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,8.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,SK하이닉스,190900,171700

HVAC, 고부가 IVI WebOS, 구독 가전 등 B2B·플랫폼 중심으로 사업 포트폴리오를 재편한 효과다. LG이노텍을 제외한 1H24 전사 매출에서 B2B 성격의 사업이 차지하는 비중은 35%에 달했던 것으로 파악된다. 2023년 당시 경영진은 2030년 전사 매출 대비 B2B 비중 40%를 목표로 제시하였던 바, 당초 계획을 초과 달성하고 있는 것이다. ② 배당 기대치 상향 가능성 높음: 당사는 올해 LG전자의 주당 배당금을 3,429원으로 전망한다. 이는 ‘24년 EPS인 13,716원에 동사가 제시한 배당 성향 25%를 적용한 수치다. 현 주가 기준 시가 배당률은 3.1%다. 이는 지금과 같은 변동성이 큰 장세 속에서 주가의 하방 리스크를 줄이는 역할을 할 것으로 판단된다. 참고로, 배당에 대한 시장 기대치는 주당 1,300원으로 상당히 낮게 형성되어 있는데, 이는 지분법 대상인 LG디스플레이의 실적 개선과, 사측의 개선된 배당 정책이 충분히 반영되지 않았기 때문으로 보인다. 당사는 LG전자의 지분법손익이 ‘23년 -1.05조원, ‘24년 -1,410억원. ‘25년 +320억원으로 대폭 개선될 것으로 전망한다[그림4]. 더불어, 이 같은 LG디스플레이의 턴어라운드는 동사 연간 ROE 개선에 +3~4%p YoY 기여할 것으로 전망되어, 밸류에이션 디스카운트 해소에도 이바지 할 것으로 판단된다.",2.0,0.0,3.0,33.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,33.0,2.0,2.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,LG전자,97200,90100

PC, 가전, 전장 등 수요 회복이 전제되어야 한다. 다만 이미 최악을 지난 것으로 판단한다. 4Q23을 기점으로 매출 증감률이 재고자산 증감률을 앞서기 시작했다[그림3]. 실제 동사를 포함한 주요 반도체 기판 업체들의 재고는 1.6년 이전으로 회귀했다[그림4]. 매출은 완만한 속도로 매월 개선되고 있는 추세다. 방향이 바뀐 것이다.② FC-BGA 신규 고객사 확보: 업황 회복은 더디나, 회사는 자구 노력으로 외형 성장의 가시성을 높이고 있다. 대표적으로, 신규 전장용 FC-BGA 업체를 확보한 것으로 파악된다. 상반기 중 생산 라인에 대한 실사를 끝내고 공급 시점을 논의하고 있다. 공급이 시작된다면 FC-BGA 가동률이 70% 이상으로 개선되며 턴어라운드 가능성이 높아질 것이다. 참고로, 1Q24 기준 가동률은 40%에 그치며 적자를 지속한 것으로 파악된다. 당사는 연간 FC-BGA 매출은 ‘22년 2,730억원, ‘23년 2,249억원, ‘24년 2,250억원, ‘25년 3,150억원으로 전망한다.③ MLB 라인업 고도화: 4Q24 이후 AI 서버, 스위치를 중심으로 MLB 제품 라인업을 다각화한다. 동사 MLB 생산 능력은 2,000억원 수준이다. 국내 경쟁사 대비 상대적으로 캐파가 작기 때문에, 지난해까지는 고부가/대물량 수주를 받기 어려웠다. 다만 2Q23 이래로 저부가 MLB 생산분을 비워냈고, 업황 재고조정까지 겹치며 이제는 자연스럽게 고부가 MLB에 대한 대응 여력이 생긴 상태다. 회사는 먼저 AI 서버용 보드, ‘25년 스위치용 보드 공급을 계획하고 있다.",24.0,14.0,55.0,78.0,10.0,9.0,12.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,12.0,10.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,13.0,11.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,14.0,55.0,78.0,10.0,9.0,12.0,11.0,3.0,11.0,12.0,10.0,9.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,8.0,7.0,7.0,13.0,11.0,1.0,13.0,0.0,13.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,대덕전자,17220,15390

KBO 리그 독점중계는 상각비 부담이 있으나 신규 가입자 증가와 광고형 요금제 등 충분히 커버 가능한 수준으로 파악된다. 미국 피프스시즌도 드라마 딜리버리 2편을 통해 지난 분기와 유사한 실적을 달성할 것으로 보인다. 분기당 2편의 드라마가 계속되면서 흥행에 따른 실적 변동성이 큰 영화, 롱테일 구조의 다큐보다 개선 효과가 두드러지고 있다. 커머스는 원플랫폼 전략 및 조직 슬림화로 수익성 확보가 이뤄질 것으로 보인다. 음악은 엠넷 광고 부문이 슬로우하지만, 라포네 JO1, INI의 성과가 일본에서 계속되고 있고 임영웅 콘서트 대행을 통해 전분기 보다 개선된 실적을 기대한다.",9.0,6.0,11.0,14.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.0,6.0,11.0,14.0,7.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,6.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,CJ ENM,CJ ENM에 해당하는 종목이 없습니다,CJ ENM에 해당하는 종목이 없습니다

SK-On은 지난 21~23년 총 20조원의 CAPEX 지출한 것에 이어 24년 7조원, 25년에도 4조원 내외의 추가 투자가 필요. 그러나 손익은 24년 약 -1조원의 영업적자, 25년 영업이익 1조원 초반에 그쳐 자체적인 투자 여력 절대적으로 부족해 외부에서 자금 확보 절실. 이런 와중에 알짜 민자 발전사인 SK E&S는 연간 약 1.2~1.5조원 내외의 영업이익 창출하는 만큼 양사 합병 이후에는 SK E&S가 SK-On의 자금처가 되어줄 수 있음.

3071,SK네트웍스,24.07.17,"목표주가 7,000원으로 하향, 투자의견 매수 유지","SK네트웍스 목표주가를 7,000원으로 기존대비 30% 하향하며 투자의견 매수를 유지한다. 2024년 예상 BPS에 목표 PBR 0.7배를 적용했다. 2분기 실적은 최근 낮아진 시장 기대치에 부합할 전망이다. SK렌터카 중단사업 분류에 따른 영향을 감안하면 전년대비 소폭 증익이 기대된다. 자산효율성 제고를 위해 적극적인 사업부 개편이 이뤄지고 있으며 이번 SK렌터카 매각으로 전사 이익규모는 감소가 불가피하다. 다만 매각 대금이 차입금 상환에 사용되는 기간 동안 이자비용 절감에 따른 순이익 개선이 가능하며 경우에 따라서 특별배당도 일부 기대해볼 여지가 있다. 2024년 기준 PER 19.7배, PBR 0.5배다.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,SK네트웍스,5110,4345
